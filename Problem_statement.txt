Skills Demonstrated:

AI/ML: Implement risk scoring models, decision trees for underwriting rules, outlier detection

Critical Thinking: Understand underwriting principles, balance risk acceptance vs business growth, consider regulatory compliance

Problem Solving: Handle incomplete applications, conflicting information, edge cases in risk assessment

Modular Structure: Separate application processing, risk evaluation, decision engine, and output generation

Clear Architecture: Flow from application data → risk scoring → underwriting rules → decision output → next steps

Deliverable: Automated underwriting system that processes applications and provides decisions with reasoning.
