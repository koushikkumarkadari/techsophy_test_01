# Life Insurance Underwriting System

This project implements an automated underwriting system for life insurance applications using the Prudential Life Insurance Assessment dataset. It uses a RandomForestClassifier to predict risk levels and makes decisions (APPROVED, REJECTED, PENDING) based on risk scores and predefined rules. A Gradio interface allows interactive input for single applications.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Required libraries: See `requirements.txt`
- Dataset: Download `train.csv` and `test.csv` from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/prudential-life-insurance-assessment) (requires Kaggle account).
